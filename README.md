# React-Clicker

## Project Overview
This project is a small interactive click-based game built using React. The app is designed to populate images of food to the user.The user is then tasked with clicking on unique images until they fail to click a unique image (The images are randomly rearranged each time the user clicks correctly). The user's score will be tracked with eac correct click. The score and images are saved within the state of the main React Component. 

## Building the App

1. I will be using the create-react-app package to install all the necessary files to create a React app.
2. I will be breaking the game into 3 components: ImageContainer.js, Image.js, images.js.
-The ImageContainer will be the consumer component while the Image component will style the images exported from images.js.
